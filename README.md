# WeatherApp

This is my first React project built with Create-react-app.

It is a single page application which fetches and presents data from OpenWeatherMap API.

This was my introduction to concepts such as:
- utilising state
- fetching, storing, manipulating and displaying data from API
- conditional rendering syntax
- passing props up and down the React DOM
